# Astrobee Pybullet/ROS Integration

Run `./setup.sh` to get started

TODOs:
- [X] Set up repository and packaging
- [ ] Set up virtual environment
- [X] Import Astobee resources into Pybullet
- [ ] Figure out a better way of generating the URDF with less manual modifications
- [ ] Debug the ISS interior collisions - V_HACD? New meshes/CAD?
- [ ] Get Astrobee ROS/simulation processes working in Pybullet
- [ ] Model cargo bag in Pybullet
- [ ] Send cargo bag properties to ROS
- [ ] Figure out more TODOs

Ask NASA:
- [ ] Can we upgrade numpy and python to newer versions?
- [ ] Can we get some of the cad files used to make the meshes?
