"""Motion control

TODO decide if this is even needed: should all of this be integrated into the Astrobee class?
(This may be needed more if we ever have multiple robots)

This might also be useful for the pybullet integration if we need to step through the sim here

TODO
- add support for multiple robots
- put all "setters" in here, "getters" in astrobee??
